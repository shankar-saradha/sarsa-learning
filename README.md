# <p align="center">SARSA Learning Algorithm</p>

## AIM
To develop a Python program to find the optimal policy for the given RL environment using SARSA-Learning and compare the state values with the Monte Carlo method.

## PROBLEM STATEMENT
The bandit slippery walk problem is a reinforcement learning problem in which an agent must learn to navigate a 7-state environment in order to reach a goal state. The environment is slippery, so the agent has a chance of moving in the opposite direction of the action it takes.

### States

The environment has 7 states:
* Two Terminal States: **G**: The goal state & **H**: A hole state.
* Five Transition states / Non-terminal States including  **S**: The starting state.

### Actions

The agent can take two actions:

* R: Move right.
* L: Move left.

### Transition Probabilities

The transition probabilities for each action are as follows:

* **50%** chance that the agent moves in the intended direction.
* **33.33%** chance that the agent stays in its current state.
* **16.66%** chance that the agent moves in the opposite direction.

For example, if the agent is in state S and takes the "R" action, then there is a 50% chance that it will move to state 4, a 33.33% chance that it will stay in state S, and a 16.66% chance that it will move to state 2.

### Rewards

The agent receives a reward of +1 for reaching the goal state (G). The agent receives a reward of 0 for all other states.

## SARSA LEARNING ALGORITHM
1. Initialize the Q-values arbitrarily for all state-action pairs.
2. Repeat for each episode:
    1. Initialize the starting state.
    2. Repeat for each step of episode:
        1. Choose action from state using policy derived from Q (e.g., epsilon-greedy).
        2. Take action, observe reward and next state.
        3. Choose action from next state using policy derived from Q (e.g., epsilon-greedy).
        4. Update Q(s, a) := Q(s, a) + alpha * [R + gamma * Q(s', a') - Q(s, a)]
        5. Update the state and action.
    3. Until state is terminal.
3. Until performance converges.
